This is a simple introduction to a form particle simulation known as Monte Carlo simulations. Before that,I expect the readers to know a bit about a Monte Carlo based approach. Well, for starters, it s based on the 'Monte Carlo Casino' in Monaco by Stanislaw Ulam who named it after his uncles gambling habits. However, I consider it as one of the fundamental inventions of mankind because of the diversity of it application is nearly all scietific field and  in almost all industries, more general, in all daily our lives (a child playing snakes and ladder game ... is also a form of Monte Carlo approach).
