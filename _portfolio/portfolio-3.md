This is a simple introduction to a form particle simulation called Monte Carlo simulations. Before that,I expect the readers to know a bit about a Monte Carlo-based approach. Well, for starters, it's based on the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco by Stanislaw Ulam who named it after his uncles gambling habits. However, I consider it one of the fundamental inventions of mankind because of the diversity of it application is nearly all scientific field and  in almost all industries, more generally, in all our daily lives (a child playing snakes and ladder game ... is also a form of Monte Carlo approach).
