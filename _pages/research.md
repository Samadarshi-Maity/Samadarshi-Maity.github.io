y research work primarily focuses on the experimental investigation of the polar fluids that are driven out of equilibrium through an 'active' drive.  These fluids comprise of rolling micro-particles that 'flow' together hence termed 'polar, active fluid'. If two or more of these active fluids are mixed, they can homogeneously mix or phase-separate based on how we confine them causing formation of rich multicomponent phases unique to such non-equilibrium systems.
