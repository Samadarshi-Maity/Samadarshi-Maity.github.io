My research work primarily focuses on the experimental investigation of  polar fluids that are driven out of equilibrium through an 'active' drive.  These fluids comprise of rolling micro-particles that 'flow' together hence termed 'polar, active fluid'. If two or more of these active fluids are mixed, they can homogeneously mix or phase-separate based on how we confine them causing formation of rich multicomponent phases unique to such non-equilibrium systems. 

I use state-of-the-art statistical methods and advanced computational workflows to extract meaningful correlations in inter-particle dynamics from TeraBytes of experimental data.  I primarily use MATLAB, Python (pandas, Matplotlib, Pyspark Pytorch, and some other subsidiary packages), and ImageJ to process the data and perform statistical analyses.
