Hello!! Thank you for stopping by. I am Samadarshi (pronounced as some-other-sh), a  doctoral researcher at the Universitiet Leiden in the Netherlands. I am work in the group of <a href = 'https://morinlab.com/'>Dr. Alexandre Morin</a> as a part of the <a href = 'https://slam-leiden.nl/Slam/Main/'>Soft, Living & Active Matter</a> cluster at LION (Leiden Institute of Physics). I specialize in experimental and theoretical non-equilibrium Statistical Physics. The details about my research (and also how I manage/process ~50+ TB of my research data) in the research section of this website. 

Outside work, you can find me reading a book in a quiet corner or playing my classical guitar. I also love to explain complex concepts at a layman level, i.e., using a methodology that needs minimum prerequisites. Check out the portfolio section, where I attempt to explain common statistical inferencing, computational and general mathematical models/problems using simple examples and tools.  

I have a deep interest in understanding the unbiased truth behind how the world operates beyond naive eyes, and that includes searching for information (for example, climate data on which regulations are framed and geopolitical statistics). I am also keenly interested in understanding finance and how its circulation rotates the world.

Please feel free to connect with me if you have any questions or if you want to discuss anything of mutual interest.
