Hello!! Thank you for stopping by. I am Samadarshi (pronounced as some-other-she), a  doctoral researcher at the Universiteit Leiden in the Netherlands. I am supervised by <a href = 'https://morinlab.com/'>Dr. Alexandre Morin</a> whose group is a part of the <a href = 'https://slam-leiden.nl/Slam/Main/'>Soft, Living & Active Matter</a> research cluster at LION (Leiden Institute of Physics). I specialize in non-equilibrium Statistical Physics. Please check out the details of my research in the <a href = 'https://samadarshi-maity.github.io/research/'>research</a> section. A Ph.D. with statistics means, of course, a lot of statistical analysis. I have detailed my data workflow to run high-end analysis for managing/processing ~50+ TB of my research data in the <a href = 'https://samadarshi-maity.github.io/Stack/'>Data stack</a> section.

Outside work, you can find me reading a book in a quiet corner or playing my classical guitar. I also enjoy travelling and spending quality time with my friends. I also love explaining complex concepts by breaking them down to a layman's level, i.e., using minimum prerequisites. Check out the <a href= 'https://samadarshi-maity.github.io/portfolio/'>projects</a> section, where I attempt to explain common statistical inferencing, computational, and general mathematical models/problems using simple examples and tools.

I have a deep interest in volunteering for social and environmental causes. I currently volunteer for the <a href 'https://voedselbankleiden.nl/'> Leiden Food Bank</a>. I also volunteer for <a href = 'https://correlaid.nl/'>CorrelAid NL</a> and Statistics without Borders: these organizations provide pro bono data and analytics services to NGOs that do not have the capacity for such wings.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or if you would like to discuss anything of mutual interest.
