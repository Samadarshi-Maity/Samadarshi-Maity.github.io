Hello!! Thank you for stopping by. I am Samadarshi ( pronounced as some-other-she…) and I am  a doctoral researcher at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. My research work primarily focuses on the experimental investigation of the polar fluids that are driven out of equilibrium through an 'active' drive.  These fluids comprise of rolling micro-particles that 'flow' together hence termed 'polar, active fluid'. If two or more of these active fluids are mixed, they can homogeneously mix or phase-separate based on how we confine them causing formation of rich multicomponent phases unique to such non-equilibrium systems. 

I use state-of-art statistical methods and advanced computational workflows to extract meaningful correlations describing the aforementioned dynamics from TeraBytes of experimental data.  I primarily use MATLAB , python (pandas, matplotlib, Pyspark and Pytorch and some subsidiary packaages as well.) and ImageJ to process the data and perform statistical analyses. 

You can check out the details about my research in the research section. 

Outside work, you can find me read a book at a quiet corner, or playing my classical guitar. I have a deep interest in understanding the truth behind how the world operates beyond the naive eyes, and that includes searching of information (example climate data on which regulations are framed, geopolitical statistics and  more recently… agricultural data on how Netherlands managed to become the 2nd food exporter in the world). I also hold a keen interest in understanding the finance and how its circulation  operates the world.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions or anything of mutual interest.
