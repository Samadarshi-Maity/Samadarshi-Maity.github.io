Hello!! Thank you for stopping by. I am Samadarshi ( pronounced as some-other-she…) and I am a  doctoral researcher at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. My research primarily focuses on the experimental and analytical investigation of polar fluids driven out of equilibrium through an 'active' drive.  These fluids comprise rolling micro-particles that 'flow' together, termed 'polar, active fluid'.

I use state-of-the-art statistical methods and advanced computational workflows to extract meaningful correlations describing the above dynamics from TeraBytes of experimental data.  I primarily use MATLAB, python (pandas, Matplotlib, Pyspark, Pytorch, and some subsidiary packages as well.), and ImageJ to process the data and perform statistical analyses. 

You can check out the details about my research in the research section. 

Outside work, you can find me reading a book in a quiet corner, or playing my classical guitar. I have a deep interest in understanding the truth behind how the world operates beyond the naive eyes, and that includes searching for information for (example climate data on which regulations are framed, geopolitical statistics and  more recently… agricultural data on how the Netherlands managed to become the 2nd food exporter in the world). I also hold a keen interest in understanding finance and how its circulation rotates the world.

Please feel free to connect with me if you have any questions or if you have anything of mutual interest.
