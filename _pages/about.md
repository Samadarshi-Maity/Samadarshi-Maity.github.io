Hello!! Thank you for stopping by. I am Samadarshi (pronounced as some-other-she), a  doctoral researcher at the Universiteit Leiden in the Netherlands. I am supervised by <a href = 'https://morinlab.com/'>Dr. Alexandre Morin</a> whose group is a part of the <a href = 'https://slam-leiden.nl/Slam/Main/'>Soft, Living & Active Matter</a> research cluster at LION (Leiden Institute of Physics). I specialize in non-equilibrium Statistical Physics. Please check out the details of my research in the research section. A Ph.D. with statistics means, of course, a lot of high-end statistical analysis. I have detailed my data workflow to run high-end analysis for managing/processing ~50+ TB of my research data in the <a href = 'https://samadarshi-maity.github.io/Stack/'>Data stack</a> section.

Outside work, you can find me reading a book in a quiet corner or playing my classical guitar. I also enjoy travelling and spending quality time with my friends. I also love explaining complex concepts by breaking them down to a layman's level, i.e., using minimum prerequisites. Check out the <a href= 'https://samadarshi-maity.github.io/portfolio/'>projects</a> section, where I attempt to explain common statistical inferencing, computational and general mathematical models/problems using simple examples and tools.

I have a deep interest in understanding the unbiased truth behind how the world operates beyond naive eyes, and that includes searching for information (for example, climate data on which regulations are framed, geopolitical statistics, to name a few). I am also keenly interested in understanding finance and how its circulation rotates the world, and regularly read about it.
