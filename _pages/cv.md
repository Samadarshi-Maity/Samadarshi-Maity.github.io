  * This enabled judicious selection of vendors to purchase high-quality furnace oil.
  * Supervisor: 

* ZEF B.V.

  * Developed an algorithm to estimate the CO2 absorption potential of different amines based on their chemical structure.Github University
  * Utilized the technique to rapidly screen and identify the most promising organic amines for developing an efficient carbon capture technology.
  * Supervisor: 

* Deloitte 
  * Collaborated with a team of five students to develop a Monte Carlo-based framework for precise computation of the carbon footprint of food products.
  * Developed a Python-driven model to estimate product-specific carbon footprints based on ingredient composition specified on the food label.
  * Presented our findings to the global sustainability team at Deloitte. 
  * Supervisor: Marion Robin (Deloitte) , Garde 9/10.
