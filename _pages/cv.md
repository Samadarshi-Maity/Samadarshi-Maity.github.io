## Internship and Work Projects 

* Deloitte 
  * Collaborated with a team of five students to develop a Monte Carlo-based framework for precise computation of the carbon footprint of food products.
  * Developed a Python-driven model to estimate product-specific carbon footprints based on ingredient composition specified on the food label.
  * Presented our findings to the global sustainability team at Deloitte. 
  * Supervisor: Marion Robin (Deloitte), Grade 9/10.

* ZEF B.V.
  * Developed an algorithm to estimate the CO2 absorption potential of different amines based on their chemical structure.
  * Utilized the technique to rapidly screen and identify the most promising organic amines for developing an efficient carbon capture technology.
  * Supervisor: Mrigank Sinha, Grade 9/10
 
* COSMO FILMS Ltd.
  * Developed fully automated calibration software for a constant-volume calorimeter to compute the combustion quality of furnace oil used to heat thermic fluid, adhering to ISO standards.
  * This enabled the judicious selection of vendors to purchase high-quality furnace oil.
  * Supervisor: Anil Gaikwad, Grade 9/10
